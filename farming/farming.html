                <p>“I believe in the future of farming”. That’s the first line in the FFA Creed. All ‘Greenhands’ (1st
                    year FFA members) memorize the creed and compete in a contest. I won the state competition in 1988.
                    Through the FFA, I got my start in radio. I started my career in political reporting. I stayed
                    connected to the farm.</p>

                <p>I retired from full-time broadcasting in 2002 to take over the family farm. Continuing education was
                    always a part of farming, and I’m proud to be a graduate of several of the best programs. T.E.P.A.P.
                    (The Executive Program for Agricultural Producers) is a program through Texas A & M focused on farm
                    financial reporting and analysis. It was founded and taught by Danny Klienfelter, a man who quite
                    literally wrote the book on farm financial reporting. The Lafayette Trading Academy was developed by
                    Al Kluis and the Kluis Commodity staff. It focuses on grain marketing, option trading and farm
                    profitability.</p>

                <p>Many people ask if, knowing what I know now, would I come home and farm? In an instant. A heartbeat.
                    The farm is rented out to a half dozen farmers, but when I think of home, that’s where my mind goes.
