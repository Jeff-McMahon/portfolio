        <p>I tell my friends “I’m very close to having seen and/or done it all”. A North Dakota farm kid that survived
          peeing on an electric fence. Tied myself to a stampeding steer (to be honest, he wasn’t stampeding when I tied
          on, that part came a little later). A radio DJ that ran a Sunday morning show under the air name “Skip
          Church”. Got a date with Carrie Underwood. Got stood up by Carrie Underwood. Retired from radio at 25 to go
          home and farm. Retired from farming at 46. Divorced - two kids, three dogs, two cats. I used to own a lake
          cabin with a bear living under the porch. Sold it - as far as I know the bear's still there. I once ran the
          boat out of gas in the middle of the lake, so I threw the Siberian Husky overboard and he swam the whole boat
          home. His name is Reno, and he’s my best friend. </p>

        <p>I tell you that to tell you this: whatever’s going on in your life, you won’t shock me. Whatever failures you
          think you’ve had, I’ve had worse and fought tooth and nail to get away from. Changing careers at 25? At 46?
          Been there, done that. Running a business with an obscene profit margin? Running a business with an incredible
          negative equity? Done both - same business. I held the camera while my parents, aunts and uncles took one last
          walk through the family farm and sat in the old equipment before it went on the auction block. I welcomed
          strangers to my farm and told them to "bid early and bid often" with a big smile across my face. I'm a heck of
          an actor, that was a tough day. I Ieft the farm May 27th, 2019. I haven't been back since. It's not that I
          don't want to, I don't think I can. The emotional toll would be more than I think I could stand. Whatever
          challenges you face, I can help you through. I’m a cheerleader for the future of farming, a counselor, my
          kid's life coach, a terrible money manager. Seriously – I'm a sucker for any raffle ticket or school
          fundraiser. Come to think of it - I've never won anything!</p>

            <p>Since the auction, I've been "retooling". Autonomous farming is the wave of the future, and I've been
              learning
              new programming languages and systems to be ready when they come. The results so far have been nothing
              short of
              amazing, and I look forward to continuing to build, evolve and transform the experiences I've had into a
              force
              for the challenges to come.</p>
